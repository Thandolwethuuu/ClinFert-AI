About 15% of couples worldwide experience infertility, with 40â€“50% of instances being due to female factors. Conventional diagnostic techniques are frequently intrusive, costly, and time-consuming, which causes therapy to be postponed and success rates to decrease.Affected people and families experience severe emotional suffering, financial hardship, and a decline in their quality of life as a result.
An accurate and effective AI-powered prediction model that determines the probability of female infertility based on lifestyle, medical, and demographic characteristics must be developed in order to solve this dilemma.
The optimal solution should identify the main risk factors that contribute to infertility, forecast the likelihood of infertility with at least 80% accuracy, and offer tailored treatment suggestions.
A successful solution will have a significant influence on lowering healthcare costs related to infertility diagnosis and treatment, improving patient outcomes through focused therapy, and increasing the accuracy of infertility diagnoses.
The intricacy of human reproductive biology, the lack of publicly available information for infertility research, and the requirement for interpretable AI models are some of the major obstacles to creating such a solution.
